Once your solution is completed please add an EXTENSIONS.txt file to your solution that notes how your application could be extended to handle the following:

Domains beyond Amazon.com
I've written the CrawlerBase class and we can pull out from any urls or files by extends this class and write the parsing function we need .


Products beyond just simply books.
By implement different parse functions and different data (else than Book Box)  we can deal with any types of things that can be refer to an object.



Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.
for this one I think I would do a multi-thread program that run may be 1000 parsing program at the same time. use  a thread pool to deal with conflict and
add to the final result. ie:database.
